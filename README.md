personal projects of mine, while I try to learn coding. It will include lots and lots of trials, experiments and failures.

I am an architect who is trying to learn how to python, for script coding for rhinoceros and grasshopper, revit and dynamo combos. will like to learn more about both revit and rhinoceros3d api.

And also have an interest in big data and machine learning and possible applications in architecture.
